# Window Master Project

To gain competancy in using the Scanner object to input user data, convert that data and return calculations based on that data

## STACK
- Java 11
- NetBeans 12.5

## REQUIREMENTS

- String variable for height (read from console)
- String variable for width (read from console)
- Float variable for height (converted from string; use float because we don't want to be limited to whole feet)
- Float variable for width (converted from string; use float because we don't want to be limited to whole feet)
- Float variable for area of window (calculated from height and width)
- Float variable for perimeter of window (calculated from height and width)
- Float variable for cost (calculated from area, perimeter, and costs)

### INPUT
